# Sparse-LInear-Models (SLIM)
SLIM model for top_n recommendation

This is a C++ implementation of the top_n recommendation algorithm SLIM from the paper

Ning, Xia, and George Karypis. "Slim: Sparse linear methods for top-n recommender systems." 2011 11th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining. IEEE, 2011.

# Requirements
* gcc
* OpenMP

# Usage
1. Type make to compile the code and generate the excutable
2. Run <code> ./slim data_file l1 l2 top_n num_threads eps </code>
where <code>data_file</code> is the 

# Data format
